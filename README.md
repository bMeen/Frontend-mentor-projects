# Frontend Mentor Projects

Welcome to my collection of Frontend Mentor challenges! 🚀 Over the course of my journey, I have worked on a variety of projects to practice and improve my skills. This repository contains a series of projects I’ve completed through Frontend Mentor to practice and improve my frontend development skills, where each project highlights different technologies and approaches to building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. Below are a few of my standout projects that demonstrate my ability to create dynamic, interactive, and well-designed web experiences:

## Standout Projects

### 1. **Todo App** 📝
   A classic to-do list app with a few extra features. Users can add, mark as complete, delete, and filter tasks by their status (all/active/completed). The app also includes a light/dark theme toggle and a drag-and-drop feature to reorder items in the list. It’s designed to be fully responsive and offers an optimal layout based on the user’s screen size.
